# mergeCounts
mergeCounts is a user-friendly tool designed to effortlessly combine count matrices obtained after feature counting in RNA-seq pipelines. It efficiently merges these matrices into a unified format, facilitating downstream analyses like differential gene expression. Users can input either the directory name or the full path, and the tool generates a consolidated count matrix within the same directory.

**Installaion:**
